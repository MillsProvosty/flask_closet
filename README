#What's in my Closet?!

## Purpose:
This app was designed for two reasons: One, I'm currently working to acquire a job working in Python, Ruby
 or Java, and needed a project to keep my skills sharp. Secondly, a friend was feeling lazy about picking out outfits
 and jokingly asked if I could create an app that could tell her what to wear. Well, here it is!
   

## Specs
This is a Flask App created with a Postgres Database. 

## To Run 

$ install python3 from python.org
$ pip3 install pipenv
$ pipenv shell
$ pipenv install flask
$ pipenv install flask-sqlalchemy
$ pipenv install flask_migrate
$ pipenv install flask_script
$ pipenv install alembic
$  ```python app.py db init``` to create the migration
$ type psql to enter into postgres, then ```CREATE DATABASE flask_closet;```
$  Back in the terminal, ```python app.py db migrate``` followed by ```python app.py db upgrade``` to migrate and update
 the
 database
$ ```python app.py db downgrade``` to reverse any migrations
$ To pry into a section ```import pdb; pdb.set_trace()```
